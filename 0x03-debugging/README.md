0-main.c: In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C projectBased on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.You are not coding the solution / function, youâ€™re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.
1-main.c: Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.Your output should look like this
2-largest_number.c: This program prints the largest of three integers.? Thatâ€™s definitely not right.Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
3-print_remaining_days.c: This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Letâ€™s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year 02/29/2000.? That doesnâ€™t seem right.Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
FILES ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘ðŸ“‘:
0-main.c

In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project

Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, youâ€™re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.c
#include "holberton.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
1-main.c

Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Your output should look like this

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat 1-main.c
#include <stdio.h>

/**
* main - causes an infinite loop
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

        i = 0;

        while (i < 10)
        {
                putchar(i);
        }

        printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

        return (0);
}
carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$
2-largest_number.c

This program prints the largest of three integers.

? Thatâ€™s definitely not right.

Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat 2-main.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "holberton.h"

/**
* main - prints the largest of 3 integers
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int a, b, c;
        int largest;

        a = 972;
        b = -98;
        c = 0;

        largest = largest_number(a, b, c);

        printf("%d is the largest number\n", largest);

        return (0);
}

3-print_remaining_days.c

This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

Output looks good for 04/01/1997! Letâ€™s make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year 02/29/2000.

? That doesnâ€™t seem right.

Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat 3-main_a.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "holberton.h"

/**
* main - takes a date and prints how many days are left in the year, taking
* leap years into account
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
    int month;
    int day;
    int year;

    month = 4;
    day = 01;
    year = 1997;

    printf("Date: %02d/%02d/%04d\n", month, day, year);

    day = convert_day(month, day);

    print_remaining_days(month, day, year);

    return (0);
}
